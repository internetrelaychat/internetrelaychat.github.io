But you don&amp;rsquo;t even know bout the code I already wrote
A long time ago, when I was stoned
In my damn home, now you think you know
But you don&amp;rsquo;t even got a fucking clue
Pics or it didn&amp;rsquo;t happen? On your head a damn shoe
You looking mad foolish, Zack, that&amp;rsquo;s the damn truth
You know the feds are watching, they coming after you</description></item><item><title>eraser - 44birds</title><link>https://internetrelaychat.github.io/music/eraser-44birds/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://internetrelaychat.github.io/music/eraser-44birds/</guid><description>crack open laptop, crackhead at the crack spot

and I hate to kick a gypsy when he&amp;rsquo;s down,
but why is it gypsy man claims he&amp;rsquo;s untrollable,
when infact his mind is quite controllable,
jewbirds chats and fame are insoluble
rising up beyond ranks no one thought was probable
fuck your disrespect and shit talking - talons put you in your place
your lack of ingenuity is a disgrace</description></item><item><title>kayos - 0101</title><link>https://internetrelaychat.github.io/music/kayos-0101/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://internetrelaychat.github.io/music/kayos-0101/</guid><description/></item><item><title>spoke - retarded</title><link>https://internetrelaychat.github.io/music/spoke-retarded/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://internetrelaychat.github.io/music/spoke-retarded/</guid><description>Took a little sniff

Is you drinking
Is you online data leaking

You sound like a cop the way you questioning me
Runnin it i stay runnin it
If you buying with the bits betta tumble it
Onion it
Dont fumble it
one false move could be humblin
Hustling
only buying on a dip
Sell on every crest
Catch a bubble while its fresh
Running it</description></item><item><title>xartet - what a chatter know</title><link>https://internetrelaychat.github.io/music/xartet-what-a-chatter-know/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://internetrelaychat.github.io/music/xartet-what-a-chatter-know/</guid><description>yo a chatter know the game
